Intro : Ahhaa was founded in 2014 with a mission to help people live a life of calm, clarity, and compassion. The company was born out of a chance encounter between former monk Ashwin Srisailam from India and wisdom teacher Diane Bacchus from the USA. East met West and Ahhaa was created. Since then, Ahhaa has been recognized by the government of India and the Foundation for the Support of the United Nations for its contributions in making the world a better place.
